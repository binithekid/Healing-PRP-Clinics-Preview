    answer: "Yes. All consultations are private, one-to-one, and conducted discreetly by a doctor. No information is ever shared without your consent."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do regenerative sexual treatments take to work?",
    answer: "Some patients notice early changes within weeks, but optimal results develop over 8–12 weeks as blood flow, nerves and tissue naturally regenerate."
